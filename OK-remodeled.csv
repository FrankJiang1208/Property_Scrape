The upper level has two levels of living with plenty of room for a person who wants to live and rent the bottom. Although an original cabin is from 1955 this home has been extensively remodeled, updated, and added on to throughout the years with a massive full remodel approx. 28 years ago.

The upper living space has brand new carpeting and turnkey and the current lowest level renter helps you get a return on your investment the moment you sign the papers and transfer the lease. The Tenants pay the rent timely, this overall combination makes this property easy to manage. The owner states that the property also comes with a large bonus and that bonus consists of the 2.6 acres of land that has Central Sewer running through the far eastern portion of the Property and that plus access to Central Water Service allows this property to possibly have a future subdivision approved for a total of Five 1/2 acre lots, a 5 Lot Subdivision would be much easier to accomplish. An actual subdivision plan was previously drawn up and recorded, the property was also surveyed in connection with the proposed subdivision many years ago. In fact, the subdivision plan still shows up on the Title for anyone to see. That plan was never submitted or followed up by anyone. As a result, the Subdivision has not been approved by the County as a subdivision, but if a person wants to take the time effort and money to go through the approval process creating the 1/2 lots they can.

This exclusive neighborhood is only a short drive to downtown Durango, all the while boasting exceptional privacy of this small ""end of the road"" gated community.  So private, you can’t even see the other homes from this parcel!  As you enter the home, you are greeted by a tall water feature that brings in the tranquil sounds of a babbling brook. Passing the water feature, the home welcomes you to the great room and the ever-present views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The kitchen, just off the great room is an open concept thoughtfully designed for entertaining both large gatherings and casual life at the expansive kitchen bar. For more intimate dining, there is a separate dining room with rounded windows providing even more spectacular views. Cathedral ceilings highlight the beautiful iron work in the main room mirroring the surrounding mountain scenery. The great room is anchored by a large, floor to ceiling fireplace ideal for warming up with a good book. On the western side of the home, you will find the first bedroom with an ensuite bathroom just off the main foyer. Down the hallway you are led to the main bedroom wing complete with a massive walk-in closet, cathedral ceilings, fireplace, beautiful mural, and immediate access to the hot tub deck. The ensuite bath is unique with his and hers setup for virtually everything from showers, separate toilets, and centrally placed large tub as well as a rain shower set in an artistic rock structure. Upstairs you will find a seating area with a large bedroom to the west that could double as a flex space for whatever you desire. On the opposite side of the seating area is another bedroom with an ensuite and eastern views. Downstairs is a walkout basement that is more than just a game room, it is home to a full gym, wet-bar, game/seating area, a brand new remodeled 3/4 bathroom, as well as an office that offers more inspiring views. Each level of this home has access to multiple decks, patios, and balcony options to take it all in. This home was designed by renowned local architect, Rick Finney, in 1999 with timeless interior and exterior finishes that stand the test of time. With that being said, the owners have taken great care to maintain the quality feel of the home over time. Embracing the Colorado mining history, you will see a few features harkening back to the days of mining carts, tracks, and mining structures for an authentic feel throughout the property. The home features many updated and thoughtful remodels. Some of the highlights are all new Trex decking, a new roof in 2019, the entire exterior was recently stucco-ed in 2019, a complete replacement of the boiler system in 2010 to a more efficient version, remodeled guest bathroom in the game-room, a remodeled shower in upstairs guest bedroom and new carpet in the gym, office, and the main bedroom closet. In the kitchen, you will find two new dishwashers, a new ice maker, and even a new trash compactor. This home is entertainment ready! National Forest surrounds this home with easy access to extensive trails straight from the property. Tripp Creek to the north of the home has two seasonal waterfalls you can hear from the house. It’s that peaceful here. The home’s location up high on the ridgeline also allows the faint whistle of the Durango Narrow Gauge train to lend to the romantic western vibe of the area. The adjacent national forest provides many wildlife viewing opportunities, from deer, elk, fox, turkey, bear and even duck on the pond found in the meadow below the home. With all the trails this makes a spectacular horse property! (only parcel approved for horses in the development). The area is known for archeological finds in nearly every direction. Come see why this is the ideal place to soak up the Colorado peace and quiet",remodeled
