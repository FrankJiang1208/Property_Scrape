Currently the lower level has a long-term renter that rents for $1150 Plus $150 per month for Utilities in the Summer and $250 for the winter months and has rented for over 3.5 years.   The upper level has two levels of living with plenty of room for a person who wants to live and rent the bottom. Although an original cabin is from 1955 this home has been extensively remodeled, updated, and added on to throughout the years with a massive full remodel approx. 28 years ago. All appliances are around 3 years old and are included.  Once used for a large ranch employee housing, the home has now been converted into a rental. The upper living space has brand new carpeting and turnkey and the current lowest level renter helps you get a return on your investment the moment you sign the papers and transfer the lease. The Tenants pay the rent timely, this overall combination makes this property easy to manage. The owner states that the property also comes with a large bonus and that bonus consists of the 2.6 acres of land that has Central Sewer running through the far eastern portion of the Property and that plus access to Central Water Service allows this property to possibly have a future subdivision approved for a total of Five 1/2 acre lots, a 5 Lot Subdivision would be much easier to accomplish. An actual subdivision plan was previously drawn up and recorded, the property was also surveyed in connection with the proposed subdivision many years ago. In fact, the subdivision plan still shows up on the Title for anyone to see. That plan was never submitted or followed up by anyone. As a result, the Subdivision has not been approved by the County as a subdivision, but if a person wants to take the time effort and money to go through the approval process creating the 1/2 lots they can.
