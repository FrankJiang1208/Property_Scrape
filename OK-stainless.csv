As you make your way inside, your party can deposit their ski gear in the two lockers located just outside of the elevator.  Upon entering, you will be greeted by the bells and whistles of modern mountain style entwined with some comfortable touches from an Italian villa.  On your left, you will notice a dining room table overseen by a bar and kitchen with granite slab countertops and stainless-steel appliances.  Allow yourself to unwind as you venture into the adjoining living room and take a stroll onto the deck while imagining the daily rituals of morning coffee, afternoon grilling with your gas grill, and après cocktails.  Relax in the privacy of the master and guest bedrooms on opposite ends of the unit that include en suite bathrooms as well as king and queen beds.  When morning comes, roll over with a restful yawn beneath the warmth of your bedding to enjoy the softly falling snow or early morning sunshine nudging you to start your day or simply encouraging you stay in bed a few more minutes.  The other two guest bedrooms include two twin beds and one queen bed just outside of their own bathrooms.  Unexpected guests?  No problem.  Welcome them to stay the evening on your sleeper sofa.  The spirit of this space lends itself to fostering a community of family and friends with its open floor kitchen, dining room, and living room tied together by a gas fireplace.
