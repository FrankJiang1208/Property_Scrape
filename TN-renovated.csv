Two living structures ready for you or your tenants, a 1080sqft detached garage/workshop, lots of potential for further development, and a beautiful pond makes this property a rare opportunity that won't last long! 

It's perfect for the large family wanting to live on the same property and farm together or a family wanting to build themselves a huge modern farmhouse back away from the road. It's also perfect for an investor who needs to put their horses or cows on a property and likes to generate income simultaneously. Or you could lease the field and garage out to another farmer while renting out the homes and maximize your cash flow potential! You don't have to look far to see that new homes are being built nearby either. And, with the center of Knoxville only 15 minutes away, you can ride Knoxville's growth projections up while you ride your side-by-side around your gently rolling property to check out your private farm with no restrictions. Work with the planning commission to figure out a plan to subdivide the existing homes or even the entire property. SO MUCH POTENTIAL! There's even another homesite between the two existing homes. All homesites are separately metered and there are two septic systems which were pumped last year. 

The large pond has several mature catfish that love bread. The fencing is in good shape and the land was leased by a cow farmer recently. The primary home had the main bedroom addition built in 2000 with a full bathroom and office nook. The spare bedroom and spare bathroom are partially refinished. The metal roof was replaced 4 years ago after it began leaking into the spare bedroom. The sellers were in the middle of finishing out the renovation in the spare bedroom when the husband became ill and has since passed. The spare bedroom needs flooring work and sheetrock/drywall work along with a new sink installed for the half-bath; or, add a shower or tub to make it a full bathroom again! Enjoy the covered porch and the comfort of updated windows with a newer metal roof. Washer and dryer also convey. Brand new water heater.

The 1080 detached garage has a concrete floor, electricity, and lots of lighting. You can fit many sizes/types of RV's or other vehicles in this big metal building and there's a small shed behind the house. The mobile home is a 2 bed/1 bath with 840sqft and connected to utilities. The remnants from the middle home and the remainder of the old barn will be removed prior to closing.
