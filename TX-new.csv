FUN FACT it's unique in design, location, and character!!The neighborhood is built on a former cattle ranch, leaving the century oaks, to line the streets and shade the yards, a desirable community because of that.   When you arrive in front of the two-story Mediterranean stucco house, surrounded by oaks, and well cared for homes with manicured lawns, the stress of the day begins to fade.  Open the front door, and you are pulled to the beautiful interior, with high ceilings and views of the large ancient oaks.   The views from every window downstairs and up, are breathtaking, which also catches your eye from the entry, as you look into the family room overlooking the creek.  The entire upstairs were put in Spring of 2019. The new roof was also put in Spring of 2019. The kitchen was updated with commercial appliances, a five-burner glass top with a heating element, a double convection, self-cleaning ovens were installed to replace the single oven/microwave.  The upper cabinets were replaced with custom solid wood cabinets with distressed finish and large open cabinet.  Display space is above all cabinets.  The microwave was replaced with a microwave, convection.  A 40"" television is also installed over the microwave, that will stay.  The counter depth Bosch refrigerator is an option.   The downstairs has Bruce hardwood floors that were installed.  Extra flooring is in the garage, as is the wood laminate and tile. New lighting fixtures were installed throughout the house.  The home is all electric. The AC is provided by 2 Trane heat pump units, one installed spring 2019 the other about three years earlier.  A new water softener was installed in 2018, a new hot water heater in 2019.     One of the unique features of this house is the upper deck, not typical of the area, the master deck is a constant connection with nature.  Master Bedroom have a huge walk-in closet. Also, a beautifully placed garden tub next to a window to look out as you bath. Waking up to the birds, the creek is part of the biannual migration route. A variety of bird are frequent visitors during migration. The backyard is currently in process of redesign. The plants are still alive with blooms.  The tomato plants are still harvesting as well. When the first freeze arrives, many of the plants will lose their battle, but all the plants will return in spring. Great for gardening.!!!!!  The sprinkler system is also functional. The green belt is large and runs along the creek.  The area behind the home is flood plain, so it will never be developed. The grade of the property brings water from the front street level to the rear.     The interior paint has been completed as well as the exterior trim. The stucco only requires power washing to maintain.",new
