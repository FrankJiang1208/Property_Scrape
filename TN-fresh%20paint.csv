Replacement windows and exterior doors throughout (glass ordered for broken window in  upper unit, to be repaired by seller).  The exterior offers an updated rubberized roof, installed in 2018.    With the interior of the building having been just renovated, the owner has decided to market the apartments as vacant, allowing for the new owners to pick their own tenants.  Both units are approved by the Elizabethton Housing Authority for Section 8 tenants, if desired, with a monthly rental of $550 per month for each apartment already agreed upon.  As a result, the projected rental income for the building is $1,100 per month with the apartments separately metered for electricity and each tenant paying their own electric bill.  Owner is responsible for the monthly cost of water which averages $104 per month.
