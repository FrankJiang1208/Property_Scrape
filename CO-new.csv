This is an end unit, which means there is only one shared wall and nobody above or below! As you walk into the home, you will notice numerous South facing windows, which provide plenty of natural light all year round. New carpets throughout the home and newer stainless-steel appliances make this home move-in ready. Plenty of room to spread out with the open concept living room and dining room along with overly spacious bedrooms. Plus, there is room to expand in the unfinished basement, another hard to find feature on attached homes! Outside you will find two patio areas to enjoy the mature landscaping and incredibly quiet neighborhood. The HOA maintains all of the landscaping as well as the roof and siding, so maintenance is simple and easy. There are a variety of other HOA perks, including a pool and clubhouse. And of course, the home is close to schools, parks, breweries, shopping, and restaurants!",new
