A very unique sporting retreat along the banks of the Gunnison River. 250 acres of prime hunting and fishing habitat with 0.9 miles of Gunnison River frontage, approximately 1.5 miles of Tongue Creek frontage, several springs, and water rights. Conveniently located just northeast of the town of Delta Colorado near the base of the Grand Mesa, the ranch enjoys year-round county maintained access via Highway 65. Towering cottonwoods line the river and stream banks and surround numerous grassy meadows and riparian areas. Views of the West Elk and San Juan mountain ranges can be seen from several locations on the ranch, as well as the Uncompahgre Plateau and the Grand Mesa. Great mule deer, turkey, quail, grouse, and waterfowl hunting and viewing opportunities abound on the ranch. There are also several Blue Heron nesting areas on the ranch, as well as good habitat for potential upland bird hunting opportunities. In fact, the western portion of the ranch once served as a private duck hunting club back in the day. The ranch qualifies for enrollment into the Landowner Preference Program, which could provide coveted mule deer buck hunting tags for those so inclined to harvest some of the high quality bucks that reside here. This stretch of the Gunnison River offers fantastic brown and rainbow trout fishing opportunities, as well as river rafting, right in your own back yard! The ranch is currently being utilized as a private sporting retreat and for cattle grazing. There is a charming 3,596 square foot main home, a 1900 historic 1,352 square foot guest house, and a 40' x 72.5' insulated shop. The main floor of the main home contains two bedrooms, one full bath, one 3/4 bath, an open kitchen and dining area with new appliances, a living room, and a sun room. The basement of the main home is partially finished with great storage space and contains two non conforming bedrooms, one 3/4 bath, and a wood stove. These two bedrooms could become conforming if the windows were enlarged to meet the county standard. The 1900 historic guest house is currently under renovation at the drywall stage, and could be custom finished to accommodate a new owner. There are incredible conservation resources on the ranch, which is why 122 acres are currently conserved by the Colorado West Land Trust. There is a beautiful location in the central portion of the ranch near the river where one could potentially build a new home, cabins or a lodge. Whether you are looking for a private sporting retreat, a potential event venue, vacation rental income, or you simply want to build your dream home in a beautiful setting close to town, the Valley Springs Ranch checks a lot of boxes!",renovated
