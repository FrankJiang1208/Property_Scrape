This gorgeous house has so much to offer that I will set the tone by starting indoors.  Walk into the entry and behold the high ceilings, wood floors, and custom inlet tile work, that all within the first two steps.  You can turn either way and the unique and beautiful finishes are going to follow you.  An open kitchen full of large knotty alder cabinets, upgraded stainless appliances and granite countertops lit with under counter lighting are what you might see.  Or you may notice the sizable separate, but not closed in, dining area.  This home boasts a wonderful split bedroom design with privacy for each bedroom area.  The laundry area continues the theme of large and open.  The master suite downstairs has a wonderful patio area to sit and enjoy views of the breathtaking landscaping.  Upstairs is what sets this home apart from any other “cookie cutter” homes.  This could be a spectacular master suite, it could be a great company suite, or you could simply make it another portion of the house that you could use for living.  There is a huge closet, its own full bathroom and a large enough area that you can let your imagination run wild.  The wood working and craftmanship doesn’t end at the front or back door though.  Step outside and enjoy professional and well-maintained landscaping, stamped and colored concrete, pergolas over two private patio’s, open wood eves and a perfect mixture of wood, glazed stucco, and stone make this home at the golf course truly one of a kind.  All of this with the convenience of having an oversized two car garage and a separate, yet attached, single car garage makes this home complete. This is not a spec home that is up for resale.  This home glows with pride of ownership.  The sellers have even completed a pre-listing inspection which is available at all showing as well as the complete set of plans for the house.  You are going to want to set some time aside to view this home, it’s not a walk through type of home, you will find a surprise around every corner.  Enjoy it.",stainless
